-------------4-25-23--------------
How do we address hyphenations?
How do we address mispellings? UK vs US?
What do we do with bots? How are we going to justify this in a manuscript?
Acronyms?
How to identify nonsense words/phrases? Delete? Is it just white noise, and not matter?
R and Python packages - which are able to handle different things like identifying weird stuff

-----------5-10-23 meeting------------
Present: Chelsea, Barret, Isaac
- Currently wrapping up preprocessing and tokenization. Over the summer, Isaac will send messages 
via Teams, or email to keep the team updated, and to request clarification, help, etc.
- Ideally, we loop in Shiyang to help oversee the logistical side of processing the Twitter data
- Goal for the summer is to run analyses on Twitter data to inform our next steps
- We discussed incorporating Reddit data as well - we'll address this issue after we finish
scripts for Twitter.

Considerations:
- Which platforms are best for different outlets (ie., Reddit, Twitter)
- Maybe we can do a methodological thing for what types of info can be best gleaned from different
social media outlets
- How does public discourse differ when platforms are anonymous vs. not?
- How does this translate to organizational settings (ie., ethics, surveys vs. emails, etc.)
- Need to look into literature to determine the current state of this area of research
