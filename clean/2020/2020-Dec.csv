Barriers to access and achievement are generally invisible to the abled (e.g. neurotypical) people. Unfortunately, this often leads to diminished understanding of their impact and the need to remove or reduce them.

This is why - e.g. - a loud, busy, open plan office is disabling for many neurodiverse people; because impaired executive function - and/or enhanced sensitivity - makes it disproportionally difficult to filter out distractions.

It's a helpful way to understand the disabling process because it focusses on identifying &amp; removing barriers to ability; rather than viewing people to be inherently less able. This is why many #disability campaigners are advocates for the model.
